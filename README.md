# Ethcad's Ultimate Armory
This is the source for my Minecraft mod Ultimate Armory, which was released in 2015 for the Minecraft 1.8 initial release. The release was announced at https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/2483939-ethcads-ultimate-armory-mod, and the mod can be downloaded from Dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/607tqxf5ddp62mj/UltimateArmory-1.0.jar?dl=0).

The mod adds many, many types of new weapons and armor. Five new materials, namely obsidian, emerald, ruby, vibranium, and adamantium. You can make armor and weapons out of all of these, and some have special properties. Try to swim with adamantium boots on. Also, there is a Captain America shield and Wolverine Claws.

I have also added grenade launchers, two types of grenades (one of them is bouncy), a teleportation gun, baseball bats of all ten materials, a crossbow, self-propelled arrows, a lightning wand, and other things that can conveniently be used for creating large explosions or culling mobs by the hundreds. Not sure why you'd want to do that, but it's there.
